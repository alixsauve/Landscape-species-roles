# Landscape-species-roles

This repository includes the scripts of the manuscript "Reshaping our understanding of speciesâ€™ roles in landscape-scale networks" by Talya D. Hackett, Alix M. C. Sauve, Nancy Davies, Daniel Montoya, Jason Tylianakis and Jane Memmott.
When using these scripts, please cite the above paper.

The folder `Mains` contains scripts to calculate the within-habitat weight (z) and the among-habitat connectivity (c) of each species from a landscape-resolved network, as well as the expected {z, c}-values if insects were randomly foraging within the landscape (see null model description in the manuscript).

The folder `Functions` contains functions called by scripts listed in `Mains`.

The R scripts will certainly need to be improved to facilitate their use on other datasets. Feel free to get in touch if you need clarification on their use, and I'll do my best to contribute to their enhancements.

# Landscape-species-roles

This repository includes the scripts of the manuscript "Reshaping our understanding of speciesâ€™ roles in landscape-scale networks" by Talya D. Hackett, Alix M. C. Sauve, Nancy Davies, Daniel Montoya, Jason Tylianakis and Jane Memmott.

The folder `Mains` contains scripts to calculate the within-habitat weight (z) and the among-habitat connectivity (c) of each species from a landscape-resolved network, as well as the expected {z, c}-values if insects were randomly foraging within the landscape (see null model description in the manuscript).

The folder `Functions` contains functions called by scripts listed in `Mains`.
